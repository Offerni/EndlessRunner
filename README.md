# EndlessRunner
An Endless Runner mobile game made in Unity 2D and C#.
Basically, you have to jump to avoid enemies while a score bar counts your points based on how much time you are alive.

In future updates, the character will be able to collect coins, jump in higher platforms while some cars run on the street and 
if the player falls, he'll have a chance to go back to the platforms if not hit by a car.

it's still under development, several changes may occur.
